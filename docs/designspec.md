## About

Onekana Digital attendance is an application that allows teachers to digitally record pupilsâ€™ class attendance. The application submits the data to an online cloud storage.

## Product Architecture

### **Design Structure**

The Onekana app's information architecture uses a *flow structure*. A flow structure is a task-based structure, requiring screens to be accessed in consecutive order when filling out forms or updating attendance.

A flow structure is best for Onekana  because it provides the flexibility needed for users interested in exploring filtered content, by making them actionable so they can make necessary changes to individual students, teachers or classes on the app.

### **Flexible Data Driven Aesthetic**

Along with being both functional and informative, the Onekana app provides a variety of filters to enable users to view only the data relevant to the specifc task they're handling on the app.

The reports section focuses on viewing, investigating, and understanding data. Infographics laid out in a dashboard invite the user to view a summary of the attendance of a class as well as the related demographics.

The UI is dense and direct, with an emphasis on typography, color, and shape.

## Layout
## Colour

Sometimes Onekana needs to show multiple infographics on a single screen, each with multiple sections. To do this, Onekana has adopted a color theme with one primary color, and five additional colors. This elaborate color theme allows Onekana to present readable, distinct infographics.

Dark Grey is used for text elements on the background and surface colors while white is used on the primary and secondary colors for contrast.

1. Dark Grey : #404040
2. White : #FFFFFF

### **Alternate Colors**

Onekana uses the color red to show the unamrked state of a radio button well as to denote errors. In some sections of the app, orange is used to show the marked state of a checkbox. Bright green is used on student tiles to show extra details to do with their demographics.

## Typography

### **Type scale**

Onekana's type scale provides the typographic variety necessary for its app content. All items in the type scale use the sans serif typeface [Prompt](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Prompt?query=prompt) as the typeface, making use of the variety of weights available with Prompt Light, Regular, Medium, and SemiBold.
